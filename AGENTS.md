# agentcad — CAD tool for AI agents

You have access to `agentcad` in a CadQuery compatibility project. The CLI
turns CadQuery Python scripts into 3D geometry. Operational commands return structured JSON with `"command"` and
`"status"` keys. `--help` and `agentcad docs` return readable text.

## CadQuery compatibility setup

CadQuery is an optional extra, not part of the default install.

```bash
pip install "agentcad[cadquery]"
agentcad init --name <project_name> --runtime cadquery
```

`init` creates the project and installs this guide, so nothing else is
required before the core workflow. `agentcad --help` and `agentcad docs` hold
the full command reference when you need more than this guide.

If `agentcad.json` already exists in the selected build directory (the project
root by default), this project is already initialized — skip `init` and go
straight to the core workflow. Use `agentcad context` to check configured state.

## Core workflow

To separate generated artifacts from source, set `build_dir = "./build"` in
`agentcad.toml` before `agentcad init`. Use `--build-dir PATH` for one command;
it selects independent history and does not edit configuration. Relative build
paths resolve from the project root, including from nested directories.
`agentcad context` reports the resolved build root. Use returned artifact paths;
`--label` names a version and deprecated `--output` is only a label alias.
See `agentcad docs artifacts` for initialization, overrides, and recovery.

1. **Write a script.** No imports needed — `cq`, `show_object`, and
   CadQuery compatibility helpers are pre-injected. At least one
   `show_object(result)` call is required.

2. **Dry-run first** to check metrics without consuming a version:
   ```bash
   agentcad run script.py --label test --dry-run
   ```
   Check `volume`, `dimensions`, `is_valid` in the response. `is_valid` is the
   deliverable verdict: the kernel check, every shell closed, and a manifold
   mesh. Do not hand a part off until it is `true`; `false` names the failing
   layer in `validation.first_failure`, `null` means a check timed out.

3. **Run for real.** Visual feedback is on by default:
   ```bash
   agentcad run script.py --label label
   ```
   A normal successful iteration can produce (paths in the JSON response):
   - `preview.png` — balanced top, bottom, upper-iso, and lower-iso composite.
     **Read this** to confirm the part looks right before iterating. The lower
     views expose geometry that a top view can hide.
   - `diff.side_by_side` — side-by-side PNG vs the most recent successful prior
     version, when one exists and automatic diff is enabled. **Read this** when
     iterating to see what your change did.
   - `diff.overlay` — centered 2D visual-overlap map (coincident gray,
     reference-only blue, candidate-only orange). It helps locate silhouette
     changes but does not prove physical correctness or shared 3D volume.
   - `viewer.html` — interactive 3D review viewer for the user unless viewer
     artifacts are disabled (humans only;
     you can't render HTML). It remains an immutable version snapshot.
     `project_viewer.url` is the live project URL: share it with the human and
     leave its tab open while iterating. Successful builds update that page
     automatically, preserving the camera and compatible review settings.
     From v2, A=previous and B=current are already loaded with synchronized
     A/B, side-by-side, overlay, diff-image, and Parts-tab change review.

   Pass `--no-preview` only for tight parametric sweeps where latency matters.
   Pass `--no-view` only when browser launch would disrupt an unattended or
   high-volume run.

   For a core-only iteration, pass
   `--no-preview --no-diff --no-view`. This writes `output.step`, the saved
   script, `meta.json` (including metrics), and explicitly requested exports
   without generating previews, automatic comparisons, viewer assets, or
   opening a browser. You can still run an explicit
   `agentcad diff OLD NEW` later.

   When a comparison is slow or incomplete, read `comparison_phases` in the
   JSON response. `source_loading`, `comparison_rendering`,
   `projection_comparison`, `exact_3d_comparison`,
   `approximate_3d_comparison`, `difference_artifact_export`, and
   `viewer_generation` each report a status
   and, when attempted, `duration_ms`. The largest duration identifies the
   expensive stage; a failed exact phase does not erase a successful projection.
   Exact 3D work has a 30-second default worker budget. Set
   `AGENTCAD_DIFF_TIMEOUT_S=N` to override it (`0` disables the dedicated limit
   for diagnostics). A timeout leaves the core version and projection usable,
   then runs a bounded voxel fallback. Approximate results report
   `method=approximate_voxel_volume`, `resolution_mm`, and a non-strict
   `error_estimate`; its `absolute_volume` values are heuristic errors, not
   measurements. `exact_attempt` retains the exact failure. Use
   `AGENTCAD_APPROX_DIFF_TIMEOUT_S` and `AGENTCAD_APPROX_RESOLUTION_MM` to tune
   the fallback. If exact volumes are still needed, run
   `agentcad diff OLD NEW` with a larger budget; do not rerun the original CAD
   command and create a duplicate version.

   Daemon-routed commands may run beyond 30 seconds. Progress heartbeats appear
   on stderr while stdout stays reserved for the final JSON response, and the
   submitted command is never automatically retried. If a silent or lost daemon
   returns `outcome: "unknown"` and `retry_safe: false`, inspect `agentcad
   context`, existing outputs, and `agentcad daemon status` before retrying; the
   original command may already have completed.

4. **Review with the user.** The live project viewer opens automatically and
   reuses an active tab. Share `project_viewer.url` for ongoing iteration;
   share `viewer` for a fixed version. Use `agentcad viewer open` to reopen the
   project, and `agentcad viewer status` or `stop` for service diagnostics. On v2+
   start with its previous/current comparison, then use A/B, Overlay, and Parts
   without selecting files manually. Use `agentcad view old.step new.step` only
   for an explicit non-adjacent comparison.

5. **Read the validation report if invalid.** A `status: invalid_geometry` run
   already carries `validation`: the failing layer, free edges by ID with
   endpoints, or the located mesh defect, plus a `suggestion`. For an existing
   file:
   ```bash
   agentcad inspect v1_label/output.step
   ```
   Intentional surfaces or sheet bodies: pass `--validation-profile kernel`.

6. **Measure feature sizes.** For dimensions beyond top-level metrics:
   ```bash
   agentcad measure v1_label/output.step
   ```
   Use this for hole diameters, cylindrical boss diameters, edge lengths,
   face areas, and full per-feature measurements with `--features`.

7. **Check explicit feature requirements.** If the prompt names measurable
   holes, bores, or cylindrical bosses, write them into `spec.json` before
   final handoff:
   ```json
   {"features":[{"name":"bolt_holes","type":"cylinder","diameter_mm":6,"count":4}]}
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   agentcad check-spec v1_label/output.step spec.json
   ```
   Revise the CAD if `passed` is false. `status: success` only means the
   comparison ran; `passed` is the actual spec-check result. If you include
   `axis`, copy it from `agentcad measure`'s `cylindrical_features[].axis`.

8. **Iterate.** Fix the script, run with a new `--label` value. Use
   `agentcad diff 1 2` to compare versions.

## Script writing rules

- This is a CadQuery compatibility project. Keep scripts on the CadQuery API.
- `show_object(result)` is required — at least one call.
- `cq`, `show_object`, and compatibility helpers are pre-injected, so a basic
  script needs no import:
  ```python
  part = cq.Workplane('XY').box(10, 20, 5)
  show_object(part)
  ```
- Helpers that operate on `TopoDS_Shape` use `.val().wrapped` as the bridge:
  ```python
  part = cq.Workplane('XY').box(10, 20, 5).val().wrapped
  moved = translate(part, 50, 0, 0)
  ```
- Imported-geometry Booleans should use `safe_cut`, `safe_intersection`, or
  `safe_fuse`; these independently copy inputs and reject invalid or
  physically impossible output.
- To show raw helper output:
  ```python
  show_object(cq.Workplane('XY').newObject([cq.Shape.cast(topo_shape)]))
  ```
- For OCP internals (`gp_Pnt`, `BRepPrimAPI`, etc.), import manually.

## Debugging playbook

1. **Check metrics first** — `volume` and `dimensions` catch most issues.
2. **Read `preview.png`** — the 4-view composite. Fastest way to spot obvious problems.
3. **Read `diff.side_by_side`** if iterating — confirms your change did what you intended.
4. **Negative volume?** Wire winding is backwards (CW instead of CCW).
5. **Need a hole diameter or edge length?** Run `agentcad measure output.step`.
6. **Need to verify explicit hole/bore counts?** Write `spec.json`, then run
   `agentcad check-spec output.step spec.json`.
7. **is_valid: false?** Read `validation.first_failure` and its layer entry:
   `shell_closure` lists the free edges with endpoints, `mesh_manifold` locates
   the defect and names the faces, `brep_check` lists kernel error classes.
8. **Open shell?** `validation.layers.shell_closure.free_edges` traces the gap;
   close the profile or add the missing face. `metrics.reliable: false` means the
   volume is not physical.
9. **Complex profiles (gears, splines)?** Use subtractive construction — cut from
   a blank cylinder/box instead of building up. See `agentcad docs patterns`.
10. **A run failed?** Trust `artifact_created: false` and `outputs.step: null`;
    fix the script and execute the returned `next_actions` command. Do not write
    or truncate STEP text — `agentcad run` or `agentcad import` must create it
    through the CAD kernel.
11. **Large inspect timed out?** It is not automatically malformed. Execute the
    returned `--validate-only` action for a structural check, or the larger-budget
    deep retry. Configure the default with `AGENTCAD_INSPECT_TIMEOUT_S`.

## Patterns

- **Build at origin, then position:** Create geometry at origin, use
  `translate()` and `rotate()` to place it. These helpers copy imported
  topology before transforming it.
- **Compound vs union:** `makeCompound()` keeps assembly parts separate. Use
  `safe_fuse(source, *tools)` for imported raw shapes; `.union()` remains fine
  for ordinary newly constructed CadQuery geometry.
- **Parametric scripts:** Top-level variable assignments become overridable via
  `--params`. Use this for iteration.
- **Named parts:** `show_object(shape, id="wheel_left", name="Left wheel",
  options={"color": "red"})` creates stable part handles, per-part metrics, and
  colored GLB output.

## Clarity

Write information for Willem in Simplified Technical English.
The same instruction applies to a pull request and to a commit message.
The same instruction applies to the text in a README and in other manuals.
Use STE at a level of approximately 80 percent.
Do not try to obey the full ASD-STE100 specification.
Use the skill in `.agents/skills/simplified-technical-english/`.

STE does not apply to these items:

- Code
- Identifiers
- Math
- CLI output
- Quoted error text

When you must show structure, flow, or architecture, use a mermaid diagram.
Do not use long text for this information.
For a large result, you can give one HTML file that contains all the information.
The HTML file is temporary.
Put that file in git only when Willem tells you to keep the file.

Make a video only when Willem tells you to make a video.
Do not add an API key.
Do not add a secret.

You can do an optional check of the manuals with `scripts/ste_check.py`.
The result of the check is information only.
The check does not stop CI.
The check is not a gate.
