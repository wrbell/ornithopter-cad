# Ornithopter CAD — instructions for Claude Code

Parametric TPU wingtip for an 8-wing flapping-wing (ornithopter) drone. Root section is the stock UIUC S1223
at 165 mm chord (must match the existing rib), tip 80 mm, span 270 mm, 15° LE sweep, 8° washout, hollow shell
with three spanwise mounting holes. Mass target ≤ 110 g per tip; the whole aircraft is ~4.2 kg with a thin
hover margin, so every gram counts.

- `ornitho/` is the library (airfoil loader, section math, CadQuery geometry, hole validation, mass report, renders).
- `wingtip.py` is the human loop: edit `CONFIG`, run, look at `out/*.png`, read `out/report.txt`.
- `models/wingtip_agentcad.py` is the agent loop: the same geometry exposed to agentcad (versioned runs,
  previews, measure, diff, viewer) through its CadQuery runtime.

## Two toolchains, never mixed

| venv | what runs there | kernel |
|---|---|---|
| `.venv` | `wingtip.py`, `pytest`, pyvista renders, `out/report.txt` | cadquery 2.8 / OpenCascade 7.9 |
| `.venv-agentcad` | `agentcad` CLI and the MCP server | cadquery 2.7 / OpenCascade 7.8 (agentcad's pin) |

`make setup` builds both. Do not pip-install across them; the two OpenCascade builds cannot share a venv.

```bash
make run                                   # full build + STEP/STL + PNGs + report   (.venv)
make test / make slow / make lint          # unit tests, OCCT tests, ruff             (.venv)
make agentcad-dry LABEL=v1                 # validity + metrics, no version consumed  (.venv-agentcad)
make agentcad-run LABEL=thin ARGS="--params wall_thickness_mm=1.6"   # versioned run + renders
make agentcad-smoke                        # end-to-end contract check of the integration
```

## Rules

1. **Coordinate frame.** x chordwise, positive aft, root LE at 0. y spanwise, positive outboard, rib face at 0.
   z up. Sections stay in planes y = const. Twist is about the quarter chord, positive = nose down. If a view
   looks wrong, fix the viewer or the camera; never re-orient the geometry to match a picture.
2. **Hole validation must pass.** `ornitho.validate.check_holes` runs before any OCCT work. A
   `HoleValidationError` (agentcad reports `status: failed` with "mount hole validation failed") is a design
   problem: move or shrink the hole. Never lower `hole_min_wall_mm` below 1.0 or catch the exception to make
   it pass. When you change holes, report each hole's minimum clearance from the report or the warnings.
3. **Look at the renders before saying done.** After any geometry change, view `out/wingtip_iso.png`,
   `out/wingtip_root.png` and `out/section.png` (from `make run`), or `build/vN_label/preview.png` and
   `build/vN_label/renders/*.png` (from agentcad), and say what you saw: LE forward, span to +y, tip nose-down,
   cavity with solid trailing edge, three full-height boss webs with bores. Metrics are not a substitute for looking.
4. **Mass comes from `out/report.txt`.** It uses a fine triangulation of the solid plus the 2D wall table.
   agentcad's `metrics.volume` is OpenCascade's analytic integration, measured about 25 % low on this spline
   loft. Use it for validity, bounding box and diffs only; never quote it as mass.
5. **Keep the design anchors.** `root_chord_mm = 165` and the stock S1223 stay unless explicitly told
   otherwise. Keep CadQuery and the kernel pins; a build123d port or a pin bump needs an explicit request and
   a green `make slow`.
6. **Commit the evidence.** Geometry changes are committed together with the regenerated `out/*.png`,
   `out/report.txt` and `out/wingtip_run.json` so the git history stays visual. STEP/STL are gitignored.

## Using agentcad here

- Run models through the CLI, not the MCP `run` tool: `make agentcad-run LABEL=<slug> ARGS="--params k=v"`.
  The CLI prints one JSON object on stdout and progress on stderr. (With current click versions the MCP
  `run` and `inspect` tools return their JSON wrapped inside an error envelope; the other MCP tools such as
  `measure`, `render`, `diff`, `check_spec`, `docs`, `context` are clean and fine to use.)
- `--params` only touches the scalar PARAMS block at the top of `models/wingtip_agentcad.py`. Anything else is
  edited in the file. Labels are short slugs (`thin16`, `aft60`).
- `agentcad check-spec build/vN_label/output.step models/wingtip_spec.json` proves the three 4.2 mm bores exist
  in the delivered STEP.
- The response's `warnings` array carries the 2D mass estimate and a note for any hole with less than 0.5 mm
  of spare clearance. The default aft hole (65 % chord) is that tight; it is a placeholder until the rib is measured.
- Artifacts live under `build/` (gitignored). `make agentcad-import LABEL=x` adopts `out/wingtip.step` from the
  main kernel as an agentcad version when you want to measure or diff the authoritative STEP.

## Definition of done

`make lint test` green; `make slow` if `ornitho/` changed; `make run` and the renders viewed; `make agentcad-smoke`
if the model script, packaging or requirements changed; the mass versus the 110 g target stated in the summary.

## Gotchas

- In `models/wingtip_agentcad.py`: no `print()` (stdout is agentcad's JSON), no `= None`, tuples or negative
  literals in the PARAMS block (CQGI cannot parametrise them), and keep the block that purges `ornitho` from
  `sys.modules` (agentcad's daemon and MCP server are long-lived and would otherwise cache stale code).
- `AGENTCAD_RUN_TIMEOUT_S` is exported as 600 by the Makefile; the build takes about 10 s but exact 3D diffs
  can take longer.
- After moving or renaming the folder: `rm -rf .venv .venv-agentcad build && make setup` (venv shebangs, the
  editable install and `build/agentcad.json` all record the absolute path).
- `.claude/skills/agentcad/SKILL.md` and the managed block in `AGENTS.md` are generated by agentcad. Refresh
  them with `make agentcad-guide` after upgrading agentcad; do not edit them by hand.
- OpenCascade's `Shape.Volume()` is unreliable on these many-span spline solids; use `ornitho.geometry.volume`.
- The S1223 trailing edge is only 0.42 mm thick at the default 1 % truncation; a printable 1 mm edge needs
  about 2.5–3 %. Flag this when printing comes up.

## Clarity

Write information for Willem in Simplified Technical English.
The same instruction applies to a pull request and to a commit message.
The same instruction applies to the text in a README and in other manuals.
Use STE at a level of approximately 80 percent.
Do not try to obey the full ASD-STE100 specification.
Use the skill in `.agents/skills/simplified-technical-english/`.

STE does not apply to these items:

- Code
- Identifiers
- Math
- CLI output
- Quoted error text

When you must show structure, flow, or architecture, use a mermaid diagram.
Do not use long text for this information.
For a large result, you can give one HTML file that contains all the information.
The HTML file is temporary.
Put that file in git only when Willem tells you to keep the file.

Make a video only when Willem tells you to make a video.
Do not add an API key.
Do not add a secret.

You can do an optional check of the manuals with `scripts/ste_check.py`.
The result of the check is information only.
The check does not stop CI.
The check is not a gate.
